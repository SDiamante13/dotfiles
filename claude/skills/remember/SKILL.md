description: Compile top 5 insights to add to CLAUDE.md before clearing conversation
---

First, read the current CLAUDE.md file to understand what's already documented.

Then review this entire conversation and identify up to **5 important things** that would be useful to add to CLAUDE.md for future sessions.

**Do not suggest anything already in CLAUDE.md.**

Focus on:
- Patterns or conventions established during this conversation
- User preferences discovered
- Project-specific knowledge that should persist
- Workflow improvements or shortcuts
- Technical decisions or architectural choices

Format as a numbered list with brief explanations. Ask for user approval before making any changes.
