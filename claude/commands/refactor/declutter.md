description: Refactor a class by removing dead code, useless comments, unused variables, and imports
usage: /refactor declutter <className>
---

I'd like you to declutter the $ARGUMENTS class by:
1. Removing any unused imports
2. Removing unused variables and methods
3. Removing redundant or unnecessary comments
4. Fixing any inconsistent formatting

## GUIDELINES

- If the tests don't pass after refactor then revert

Please only make these types of changes and explain what was removed or simplified.
