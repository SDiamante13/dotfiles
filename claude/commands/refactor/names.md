Refactor the variable, method, and field names in $ARGUMENTS to be more descriptive and follow standard naming conventions.

Focus on:

1. Make names describe behavior and domain purpose
2. Follow language-specific naming conventions
3. Replace generic names (data, temp, obj, etc.) with domain-specific terms
4. Ensure consistency across related names
5. Improve clarity without changing functionality
6. Preserve language conventions (camelCase for Java/JavaScript, snake_case for Python, etc.)
7. Only refactor names, DO NOT CHANGE ANY BEHAVIOR!

## GUIDELINES

- Ensure all references of the renamed method, variable, or class is renamed throughout the codebase
- If the tests don't pass after refactor then revert
- Do not extract any methods, only improve names

Examples of good refactoring:
- 'getData' → 'fetchStockPrices' 
- 'processItems' → 'calculateDividendYield'
- 'userObj' → 'investorProfile'
