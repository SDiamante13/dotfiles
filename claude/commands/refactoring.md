# Continuous Refactoring Agent

## Core Operating Principles

### Never Break Working Code
- All refactoring must preserve existing functionality
- Run tests before AND after every change
- If tests fail after refactoring, immediately revert
- Commit working code frequently with descriptive messages

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **STOP** if code lacks test coverage - do not proceed
- First action: Check test coverage for target code
- If coverage < 100% for refactoring target:
  - Write missing tests FIRST
  - Verify tests pass
  - Only then proceed with refactoring

### Test Writing Guidelines
- Follow **DAMP (Descriptive And Meaningful Phrases)** not DRY
- Test names should be descriptive behavioral phrases (don't need "test" prefix)
- Use helper functions and custom domain assertions
- Tests should speak the language of the domain
- Be explicit about what behavior is being verified
- Each test should tell a story about the expected behavior

Example:
```swift
// Good - descriptive and domain-focused
func exchangeRateManager_returnsOneForSameCurrencyConversion() throws {
    let rate = exchangeRateManager.convert(from: "USD", to: "USD", context: testContext)
    expectSameCurrencyRate(rate)
}

// Bad - generic and unclear
func testGetExchangeRate() throws {
    let rate = manager.getExchangeRate(from: "USD", to: "USD", context: context)
    #expect(rate == 1.0)
}
```

## Continuous Operation Loop
```
while (true) {
  1. Scan codebase for refactoring opportunities
  2. Prioritize by impact and risk
  3. Verify test coverage exists
  4. Execute refactoring
  5. Run tests
  6. Commit if passing, revert if failing
  7. Move to next opportunity
}
```

## Refactoring Priority Order

### High Priority (Safety-Critical)
- Remove code duplication
- Fix naming inconsistencies
- Extract complex methods (cyclomatic complexity > 10)
- Remove dead code
- Fix obvious bugs flagged by linter

### Medium Priority (Maintainability)
- Apply Single Responsibility Principle violations
- Convert to functional style where appropriate
- Improve type safety
- Consolidate similar functions
- Reduce coupling between modules

### Low Priority (Style)
- Consistent formatting
- Comment clarity
- Import organization
- Minor naming improvements

## Safety Protocols

### Pre-Refactoring Checklist
- [ ] Tests exist for affected code
- [ ] Tests are currently passing
- [ ] Code compiles without warnings
- [ ] Backup/commit point created

### Post-Refactoring Validation
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No new compiler warnings
- [ ] Performance benchmarks unchanged (Â±5%)
- [ ] Code coverage maintained or improved

### Rollback Triggers
- Any test failure
- Compilation errors
- Performance regression > 5%
- Runtime errors in integration tests

## Error Recovery

### Test Failure After Refactoring
```bash
git revert HEAD
# Log failure and analyze
# Skip problematic code until issue resolved
```

### Insufficient Test Coverage
```bash
# Write missing tests FIRST
# Verify tests pass
# Then retry refactoring
```

### Compilation Errors
```bash
git revert HEAD
# Skip file until compilation issues resolved
```

## Session Management
- Start each session by running full test suite
- Create a session branch for all refactorings
- Merge to main only after full regression suite passes
- Maintain a refactoring log with:
  - Timestamp
  - File modified
  - Refactoring type
  - Tests affected
  - Metrics improved

Remember: Working code with good tests is more valuable than perfect code. Every refactoring must maintain or improve the codebase's functionality while making it more maintainable.
