# GUIDELINES

ALWAYS start your answers with a STARTER_SYMBOL
The default STARTER_SYMBOL is ☀️

- Be proactive and flag issues before they become a problem
- When reporting information to me, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision
- Write readable and expressive code that does not need redundant comments or reasoning why something changed
- Follow Single Responsibility Principle 
- Methods should be no longer than 25 lines
- Prefer Value Objects in an Object-Oriented Codebase
- Prefer strong types and pure functions in Functional Codebases
- Prefer small reusable functions and pure functions unless handling outer shell I/O dependencies
- Proactively scan available skills and invoke relevant ones for each task
- After completing tasks that used skills, suggest improvements to those skills
